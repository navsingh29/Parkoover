Grasshoppers
============
Okay guys, some library files are too big to share on github so we have to do the following...
Instructions:
1. Create new Web Application Project
 name it: ParkFinder
 with package name: com.grasshoppers.parkfinder
2. in the newly created directory, use git clone to pull the project and overwrite everything.
OR if you already have the repsoitry on you computer, make sure it is up to date and in master branch and copy everything
including the .git stuff which is hidden by default. Overwrite everything. If you guys are confused, ask me (Nav) in lab on Friday.
In the meanwhile just work on the project locally. Don't commit your whole project, unless you use .gitignore. It won't work. The library files are like 50mb.
